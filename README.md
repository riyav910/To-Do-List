# To-Do List Web Application

This is a simple To-Do List web application created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app allows users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks. It also saves the user's tasks in the browser's local storage, ensuring the task list persists even after the page is reloaded.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Users can input a new task and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Click on a task to mark it as completed (strikethrough), and click again to unmark it.
- **Delete Tasks**: Each task has a delete button (×) to remove it from the list.
- **Persistent Data**: The tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so the list remains intact after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: To style the webpage, including a custom layout, task list appearance, and interactive elements.
- **JavaScript**: Provides functionality to add, remove, mark tasks as completed, and store data in local storage.

## File Structure

1. **index.html**: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the To-Do List.
2. **style.css**: The CSS file used for styling the application, including layout, buttons, and task list.
3. **script.js**: The JavaScript file that implements the core functionality, such as adding, deleting, and marking tasks, and saving them to local storage.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. You can now use the To-Do List web app to add, complete, and delete tasks!

- **Deleting a Task**: Click the "×" icon next to a task to delete it.

## Local Storage

The app uses local storage to save tasks. This means your task list will persist across page reloads and browser restarts. Tasks are stored automatically every time they are added, deleted, or marked as completed.
